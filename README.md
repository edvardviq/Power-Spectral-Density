# Power-Spectral-Density [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/652526054.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/652526054)
A MATLAB function to calculate the power spectral density of the random signal using the modified Welch's alghorithm.

File example.txt contains the single collidal CdSeS/ZnS quantum dot blinking data. Example.m is the MATLAB script intended to familiarize you with the procedure for working with the necessary functions.

getPSD.m is the function that calculates the power spectral density of the signal together with the frequency and chi-squared number of degrees of freedom to estimate the confidence interval.
plotPSD.m is the function to plot the resulting PSD.
